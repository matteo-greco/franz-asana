# franz-asana

This is an update of an existing Asana recipe for Franz so that it is compatible with Franz 5.0.0. Try it out and let me know

## Installation
1. To install a new integration, download the integration folder e.g `asana`.
2. Open the Franz Plugins folder on your machine (note that this `dev` directory may not exist yet, and you must create it):
  * Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Franz/recipes/dev/`
  * Windows: `%appdata%/Franz/recipes/dev/`
  * Linux: `~/.config/Franz/recipes/dev`
3. Copy the `asana` folder into the plugins directory
4. Reload Franz
